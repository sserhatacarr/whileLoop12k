# Divisible by 3 and 4 Checker

This simple Java program checks for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 4 within a specified range and calculates their average.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the Main.java file.
2. Compile the Java program using `javac Main.java`.
3. Run the program using `java Main`.

## How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter a number (`k`).
2. It then iterates through numbers from 0 to `k` (inclusive).
3. For each number, it checks if it's divisible by both 3 and 4.
4. If a number meets this condition, it increments a counter and updates the total sum.
5. After the loop, it calculates and displays the average of these numbers.
6. If there are no such numbers found, it informs the user.
